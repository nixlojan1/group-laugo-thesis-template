# Thesis Markdown Template

SportsComplex Reservation Management

## How to use
1. Replace placeholder content in each `.md` file.
2. Keep sections modular (one file per page) in their respective chapter folders.
3. Use `index.md` as the entry point. Links already point to each section.
4. (Optional) Build a site with MkDocs:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   mkdocs serve        # local preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
   mkdocs build        # outputs site/ directory
   ```

## Folder layout
See the tree below or open `mkdocs.yml` to adjust the sidebar navigation.
